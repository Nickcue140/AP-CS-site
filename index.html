          This is my drawing app. It is not very advanced, but it has some
          features that I think are very interesting. I added a glide to button,
          which when combined with the draw shape you can make those squiggly
          lines or when combined with space can make textured lines.

        <h2>Personal Project</h2>
  
        </p>
        <p>
          The personal project I chose was my pc. When I was in 6th grade I
          wanted a PC, but I didnâ€™t have the knowledge to build one, or the
          money to buy a super good one. I settled for a super cheap one and
          that kept me happy for a while. Around 7th grade I decided that I
          still wanted a better PC. I ended up slowly upgrading over time up to
          this point. I ended up enjoying the pc building hobby so much that I
          now have two computer setups becuase of the amount of upgrades I have done on my PC. Now every time a friend needs
          a fix, upgrade, or build they ask me to do it.

        <p>
          For my scratch project I chose to make a farming game. You are able to
          plant corn by pressing space and when you get enough you can go to the
          house to win. My goal was to make the corn grow over time, then be
          able to collect it. To accomplish this I used a lot of wait blocks.
          This allowed the code to stop for a bit to pretend like the corn was
          taking time to grow.
